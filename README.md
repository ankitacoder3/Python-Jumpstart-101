## Steps for Execution

  1. Clone the ```'Python-Jumpstart-PY101'``` github repository.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/ankitacoder3/Python-Jumpstart-PY101.git
      ```
     
 2. Navigate to the ```'PY101' Directory``` in that.
    ```sh
    cd Python-Jumpstart-PY101
    cd PY101
    ```

  3. Navigate to ```ANY of the Directories``` and ```execute the respective files``` present in that directory, by following the below ```given steps```. 
    
     
      i. ***Navigation*** :
          <br>
          Navigate to the respective directory.
          <br>
          For example: Navigate to the **'Dictionary_Files' Directory**.x
        ```sh
        cd Dictionary_Files
        ```
      
      ii. ***Execution*** :
          <br>
          By opening ```any file``` in ```python idle``` or ```command prompt```, and running it.
          <br>
     
      a. ***Python IDLE*** 
       * To execute any file from Python IDLE,
        <br>open the ```python file <filename>``` in the ```IDLE```.
        
       * **RUN** it, by clicking on ```RUN``` at the top bar, then clicking on ```RUN MODULE```.
        
       * For example: To execute **'Program1.py' File**,
        <br>open the ```**'Program1.py' File**``` in ```IDLE``` and ```Run``` the file.

       * Then ```follow the instructions```, which appear on ```IDLE prompt```.
      <br>

     b. ***Command Prompt*** 
      * To execute any file from command prompt, 
        <br>navigate to the folder that contains the ```python file <filename>```, in the ```command prompt```.
      
      * Type the following command in command prompt
        ```sh
        python <filename> <arguments (if any)>
        ```
     
      * For example: To execute **'Program1.py' File**,
        <br>navigate to the ```./Program1.py``` *Folder* path in the ```command prompt```.
        <br>
        <br>then type
        ```sh
        python "Program1.py"
        ```

      * Then ```follow the instructions```, which appear on ```command prompt```.
