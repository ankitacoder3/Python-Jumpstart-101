### <b>Underlying concepts / theory :</b>

  1.  **Inclusion of Image Processing Techniques**
     
      The project ```IMG-IMPACT``` involves the implementation of ```Image Processing Techniques```.

  2.  **Manipulation of Images and Extraction of Insights**

      Image processing entails the ```manipulation of images```to extract ```useful insights``` from them.

  3.  **Representation of Images as Grids of Pixels**

      Images can be represented as a ```grid of n x n small pieces```, which are called ```pixels```.

  4.  **Numerical Representation of Image Pixels**
 
      If we can ```assign numbers to each colour```, then, the grid of pixels can be represented as a ```numerical matrix```.

## Prerequisites and Techstack

<br>
    
  * Language :

    **Python**

<br>

  * Libraries :


    * OpenCV or cv2
    * Pillow or PIL
    * NumPy
    * argparse
    * matplotlib
    * math


<br>

  * Concepts :
    <details>
    <summary color= blue><u><b><i style="color: blue;">Linear transformation, SVD, Fourier transformations</i></b> (click for more details...)</u></summary>
      
    <p style="fontcolor: purple;">
      
      * **Linear transformation** -

        Linear transformations are mathematical operations that maintain the fundamental properties of vector spaces.
        They are often represented using matrices and are essential in geometry, and transformations in computer graphics.
        They provide a structured way to describe and manipulate complex relationships between vectors.
        
      * **SVD**-
   
        Singular Value Decomposition, or SVD, is a powerful matrix factorization technique that breaks down a matrix into three simpler components: U, Σ, and V.
        Here, U and V are orthogonal matrices, and Σ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values.
        SVD is employed in image compression, as it uncovers hidden patterns and relationships in data
        
      * **Fourier transformations** -
   
        Fourier transformations are mathematical methods used to represent functions or signals in the frequency domain.
        The Fourier transform allows us to express complex signals as combinations of simpler sinusoidal components, revealing their frequency and amplitude characteristics.
        This is particularly useful for analyzing and processing signals in fields of image analysis, and data compression.

## Steps for Execution

<br>

  1. Clone the ```'Image-Processing-IMG-IMPACT'``` github repository.
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/ankitacoder3/Image-Processing-IMG-IMPACT.git
      ```
     <br>
     
 2. Navigate to the ```'IMG-IMPACT' Directory``` in that.
    ```sh
    cd Image-Processing--IMG-IMPACT
    cd IMG-IMPACT
    ```
  <br>

  3. Navigate to ```ANY of the Directories``` and ```execute the respective files``` present in that directory.



      <br>

     
      i.  ***Navigation*** :
          <br><br>
           a. Navigate to  ```'Individual_Filters_Techniques' Directory``` to execute techniques and filters ```separately```.
        ```sh
        cd Individual_Filters_Techniques
        ```
      
      <br>

     b. Navigate to  ```'All_Filters_Combined' Directory``` to execute techniques and filters ```combined```.
      ```sh
      cd All_Filters_Combined
      ```
      
      <br>
      
      c. Navigate to  ```'Extra_Contents' Directory``` to find ```extra information``` about the filters and techniques.
      ```sh
      cd Extra_Contents
      ```
      
      <br>
           
     d. Navigate to  ```'Images' Directory``` to ```edit``` the images used.
      ```sh
      cd Images
      ```
      
       <p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">Back to TOP</a></p> <br>
      
     ii.  ***Execution*** :

     By opening ```any file``` in ```python idle``` or ```command prompt```, and running it.
     
     <br>
     
     a. To execute any file from command prompt, type
        ```sh
        python <filename>
        ```

        Then ```follow the instructions```, which appear on ```command prompt```.
      
      <br>

     b. For any file from  ```'Individual_Filters_Techniques' Directory```, say ```1_ColourFilter.py```, type
      ```sh
      python 1_ColourFilter.py
      ```

      Then ```follow the instructions```, which appear on ```command prompt```.
      
      <br>
      
      c. For any file from  ```'All_Filters_Combined' Directory```, say ```IMG-IMPACT.py```, type
      ```sh
      python IMG-IMPACT.py
      ```

      Then ```follow the instructions```, which appear on ```command prompt```.
      
      <br>
    
     

     <br>
    
  Note- For some filters and techniques information may not be complete or it may not exist in the'Extra_Contents' Directory.
